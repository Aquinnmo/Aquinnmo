## Hi there I'm Adam üëã

I am computer science major at the University of Guelph that's about to go into my second year. I am enrolled in co-op, and am actively looking for my next position! I am searching for the summer 2026 term, and am more than open to chat about any opportunity!

I am an avid communicator that loves is exceedingly social. I thrive in team environments where you can build strong connections with your peers. I have always prided myself on being a leader that knows when to step back and let others take the reigns as well.

I also love music, some of my favourite artists being A$AP Rocky, Young Thug, and Pink Floyd. In my spare time, I'll either be jamming out to these artists or watching sports. My favourite teams are the Chicago Blackhawks, Toronto Blue Jays, and the Vegas Golden Knights. My favourite hockey player of all time is Duncan Keith.

I not only watch sports though, I also play them. I have played hockey since I was very young, moving up through the competitive leagues until moving into the more relaxed ones nowadays. I have always played defence, making both Duncan Keith and Cale Makar exceptional role models for my play style.
